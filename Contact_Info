Since not all of us are in class, I figured it would be a good idea to make this. 
If you could just type your name, phone number and email in this file, that way we can be in contact with each other. 
In addition we should probably meet up in order to set up the requirements due the 27th, 
  so list your availability and we can set up something.

    Anytime after 10 MWF, after class TTh, anytime during the day on the weekend if I have some advanced notice.
